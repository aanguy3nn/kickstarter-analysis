## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis performance based on Kickstarter Campaign data

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
  Using Lousie's Kickstarter Campaign data, onw qill be able to analyze the data while working through excel to create conclusions and analyze theater outcomes and compare it to the launch data and goals. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze various kickstarters from Lousie's campaign data   lauch dates and goals. To succesfully analyze the data, one must go through module 1 on the UCB Bootcamp canvas site. 

## Analysis and Challenges
I perfromed my analysis using excel with the data provided. 

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Creating a pivot table allows us to analyze outcomes of kickstarters with filters to get specific datasets to be shown. Challenges that arise while performing this task was the row lable showing as years instead of months. To resolved that problem you want to make sure the only item taht is in the rows is 'date created conversion'.

### Outcomes Based on Goals
Using the data provided in the excel sheet, I was able to analyze the data using "CountIfs" to determine the range of successes, failed, and cancled theater kickstarters. Then used sums and percentages to dertermine the total projects and percentage of success, failed, and canceled events. Challenges that arised through this project wasmaking sure the range was correct and formating the countifs statements correctly.

## Results

Through simple observations with the dataset that represents the theater outcomes based on launch dates, there were a variety of different components that allowed for conclusions to be made. To begin with, there are no drastic fluxes in canceled events while the month of MAy has the most succesfful rate of theater outcomes. THis could be described through the influx of more freetime amoungst the human population since they have less obligations to school. THere is also a correlation that there is a higher chance of goals being met if theaters have a lower goal. We are able to tell by looking at the outcome based on goals graph since the percentage failed is greater than 80% for a goal greater than $50,000. While anything that has an asking goal of less than $19,999 dollars is more likely to be more sucessful. 

Limiations that do arise from analyzing this dataset is what type of media is being played at the theaters. I think it would be benefincial to analyze what is the most popular and compare it to the season since it would help louise know when the best time to release the media into theaters. Furthermore this will help give her advice to see which showings would provide a fkux in success, failed, or canceled during the year.
